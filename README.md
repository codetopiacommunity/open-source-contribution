# About Project

This initiative is an integral part of the Codetopia community's open-source projects. Its primary objective is to provide you with insights into our approach to contributing across various projects within the Codetopia community's open-source ecosystem. While this guide is tailored for the current project, its applicability extends to all endeavors under the Codetopia community's open-source umbrella.

It's essential to note that this guide doesn't prescribe a rigid set of rules; instead, it serves as a flexible framework to assist you in initiating contributions to open-source projects. We encourage an open exchange of ideas and improvements for this project, as well as for any other initiatives within the Codetopia community. Your input is valued, and we welcome suggestions or enhancements.

## Friendly Guide to Open Source

This guide is designed to help you get started with open-source contributions. It's a step-by-step guide that will walk you through the process of making your first contribution to an open-source project. We hope that this guide will help you feel more comfortable with the idea of contributing to open-source projects and that it will encourage you to get involved in the open-source community.


## First things first

If you are a total beginner in the open-source world, there are some things you need to know before you start contributing to open-source projects. 

You need to know the following:
- The Linux(Unix) Shell and the terminal
- How to navigate the file system
- How to manipulate files and directories
- Version Control System (Git and Github)

If you are not familiar with these concepts, we recommend you to learn about them before you start contributing to open-source projects. We highly recommend you to take a look at the following resources:


1. [Introduction to Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

> **Note:** After completing the summary and setup section, We recommend you to complete the first three lessons of this resource before you start contributing to open-source projects.

This is a great resource to learn about the Unix shell and the terminal. It will help you to understand how to navigate the file system, how to manipulate files and directories, and how to use the terminal to interact with your computer. 


2. [Introduction to Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)

This is a great resource to learn about version control systems and Git. It will help you to understand how to use Git to manage your code and collaborate with others.

After you have completed these resources, you will be ready to start contributing to open-source projects.
